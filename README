εncooη
Copyright David Lambert 2023

For the time being, εncooη is an experimental web-based application 
oriented toward data management.

The object of the reasearches εncooη is based on is to propose 
a true engine that allows data structuration, data relationship 
management, data presentation, and, mainly, to make obvious data navigation.

This brand new application doesn't require database system 
learning or skills, because everything in the application 
is managed through a very simple web-based user interface, 
in real time. 

Primary dedicated to small business structures, 
the application lets manage a large amount of multi-purposes information 
within the organization, and share this information across business stakeholders 
in an easy and natural way, using one Internet browser only.

εncooη is also the foundation for the development of a true business-oriented 
application development toolkit.
