    introduction: "For the time being, Encoon is an experimental web-based application oriented toward data management.<br/>
                   The object of the reasearches Encoon is based on is to propose a true 
                   engine that allows <strong>data structuration</strong>, 
                   <strong>data relationship management</strong>, 
                   <strong>data presentation</strong>, and, mainly, to make obvious <strong>data navigation</strong>.<br/>
                   This brand new application doesn't require database system learning or skills, 
                   because everything in the application is managed through a very <strong>simple web-based user interface</strong>, in <strong>real time</strong>.
                   Primary dedicated to small business structures,
                   the application lets manage a large amount of multi-purposes information within the organization,
                   and share this information across business stakeholders
                   in an easy and natural way, using one Internet browser only.<br/>
                   The application is supposed to be hosted within the organization itself,
                   on a local server (Windows, Mac or Linux), or even on the Web. 
                   Encoon is also the foundation for the development of a <i>true business-oriented application development toolkit</i>."
