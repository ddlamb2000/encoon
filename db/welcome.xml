      <description>Welcome to Encoon! For the time being, Encoon is an experimental web-based application oriented toward data management. The object of the reasearches Encoon is based on is to propose a true engine that allows data structuration, data relationship management, data presentation, and, mainly, to make obvious data navigation. This brand new application doesn't require database system learning or skills, because everything in the application is managed through a very simple web-based user interface, in real time. Primary dedicated to small business structures, the application lets manage a large amount of multi-purposes information within the organization, and share this information across business stakeholders in an easy and natural way, using one Internet browser only. The application is supposed to be hosted within the organization itself, on a local server (Windows, Mac or Linux), or even on the Web. Encoon is also the foundation for the development of a true business-oriented application development toolkit.</description>
