	oriented toward data management.</p> <p>The object of the reasearches εncooη is based on is to propose 
	a true engine that allows data structuration, data relationship 
	management, data presentation, and, mainly, to make obvious data navigation.</p> <p>This brand new application doesn't require database system 
	learning or skills, because everything in the application 
	is managed through a very simple web-based user interface, 
	in real time.</p> <p>Primary dedicated to small business structures, 
	the application lets manage a large amount of multi-purposes information 
	within the organization, and share this information across business stakeholders 
	in an easy and natural way, using one Internet browser only.</p> <p>εncooη is also the foundation for the development of a true business-oriented 
	application development toolkit.</p> <p>Copyright David Lambert 2024</p></div>`;
