React and JSX
    <!-- Don't use this in production: -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>

    Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
    https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project

    In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
    https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

    You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
