  # secret key to generate JWT tokens
  # JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a popular method for dealing with online authentication
  # you should use a cryptographically secure string for your secret key
  # it's recommended to use the same approach as the initial root user password (see below)
  # to set a different secret key for each database
